# Othello AI

## What?

Othello is a simple game featuring an 8x8 board and a set of tiles where one side is black the other is white. Players take turns placing down tiles, with the goal of ending up with the most tiles in their color. The tric is that "sandwiching" the opponent's tiles between two of your own wll conver them to your color.

## Why?

For a senior AI assignment, we were to implement some form of an artificial intelegence algorithm. We decided to implement the mini-max algorithm at various max tree-depths, as well as a greedy algorithm. The resultant program and our final report are in this repository.
